<p>This isn't for you.  I have taken a hiatus and haven't really written--well, anything really--in the past few years.  This site will have typos.  I don't care.  This site will have grammatical issues and probably tense fluctuation.  again.  I don't care.  Sometimes I will give you something meaningful,  other times I might just share something that I find interesting.  If you can find any use from these ramblings of my broken, twisted, mind.  great.  Otherwise  please remember.  I am not doing this for you.  <br><br>But if you stay.  if you choose to ignore the warning signs and decide to look past the velvet curtain on which strings you now hold.  Welcome.  I love you.  and good luck</p>
