<h2>You don't have to be a superhero</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Do you have what it takes to fight a dragon?  Probably not,  but that's okay.  Most princesses these days are in very little need of rescue.  Courage isn't something that you have.  It is the choice to stand up and act on your beliefs.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Courage comes from a willingness to take a risk,  to open yourself up to the vulnerability that comes with showing the world the person you are, and not what the world expects you to be.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Courage is what it takes to say "I am going to love you" even if you don't know that the person you love will reciprocate--and especially if they already love one or more other partners.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Courage is what it takes to sleep alone knowing that your partner is sharing a bed with a lover, and being able to love them anyway.  Courage is trusting against reason.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Courage can't promise a happy ending.</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Courage doesn't come with any guarantees.  Courage is something you practice.  day by day. knowing that if you fail--you will get another chance.  Always.</p>

<h2>Love, real and raw, is scary.</h2>

<p>Remember this:  If you want to learn how to ride a bike:  Buy a bicycle, and practice.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you want to learn how to love:  Find someone.  Love them.  Let them love you.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You cannot conquer your fears by avoiding your fears</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Courage is the willingness to work for the things you want--and never giving up.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
