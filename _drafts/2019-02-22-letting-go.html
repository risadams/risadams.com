<p>Enter Scene: spring 2003.  My freshman year of college was wrapping up and I had signed a lease for my first apartment with three other nerdy lads.  Roommate 1: CS -- provided the `Japanese culture is best` stereotype.  Roommate 2: FG -- the gentle giant.  He loved cartoons and Dance-Dance-Revolution.  Roommate 3: KC -- the scary guy who lived on our basement; he had pet lizards and would bring home small animals to dismember.  KC once told me that he killed a vampire and asked if I wanted to see the body; I'm not sure whether he was joking, but I refused to find out.  And then there was me -- the music geek with no particular talents, and all the social skills that comes with a lifetime of solitude.</p>

<p>I began working retail at a big-box office supply chain. I wanted to help buy the technology that would change improve their lives.  My employer only cared about pushing useless "extended protection" plans that were rarely honored or needed.</p>

<p>This was a difficult period in my life. I suffered from severe depression, anxiety, and self-abusive behavior. I will not go into details about my mental health for this article, but feel that these details are important to understand what comes next.</p>

<p>It was not uncommon for lunch breaks to overlap with co-workers, and on one otherwise unusual Tuesday, I shared 45 minutes with V. V was 21 years old (I was 19), five feet three inches tall.  She had shoulder-length blond hair and chestnut brown eyes.  Of course, I was deathly afraid of her.  Our break television was playing an old Simpsons re-run, and in the most unexpected turn-of-events: V offered to share a bag of white-chocolate covered pretzels.  This broke me. </p>

<p>Over time, we became friends. I think that I was the one who fell in love first. The problem was her fiance--B.  B was a good man, they shared an apartment with another couple (one of whom was actually my boss!), two rowdy pit-bulls, and one old cranky cat. As our relationship grew stronger, B saw me as less of a threat while V began to rely on me more-and-more.  Eventually V fell in love with me too.  </p>

<p>Thus began my first delve into the world of non-monogomy.  I was of course familiar with Polyamory, and perhaps even a little intrigued at the thought. But we were young. It was a struggle just trying to figure out who we were, and it wasn't the right time to try navigating the complex webs of multiple-partnerships.</p>

<p>I was the one who let go first.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I pushed her away. It was a <a href="https://www.risadams.com/tuesday-begins/">Tuesday</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I broke her.</p>

<p> This broke me. </p>

<p>Our relationship lasted less than two years, but It took me almost ten more to recover from our relationship and to become mentally-stable enough to find myself.  While I have purposely left out many details, I have tried to stay faithful and honest to the important bits.</p>

<p>Today: I am still Polyamorous, and I am happily married to an amazing and supportive woman--who I am grateful to have in my life. </p>
