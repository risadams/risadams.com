<p><br> There are 8 billion people out there<br> You don&rsquo;t have to be friends with them all<br> Don&rsquo;t let anyone hold you back or down<br> We waste hours and days and years with negative people<br></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p> Collect awesome people<br> Network your butt off. Talk to everyone nice<br> Make sure they aren&rsquo;t transactional networkers<br> Nice people don&rsquo;t keep score<br> They generously share their network<br> And ask for nothing in return but your professionalism<br> </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t use a credit card and get into debt if you can<br> </p>

<p>Whatever you want to buy you likely don&rsquo;t need it<br> Get a laptop and an iPad and buy experiences<br> Don&rsquo;t buy things. Avoid wanting things<br> If you can avoid want now, you&rsquo;ll be happier later<br> None of us are getting out of this alive<br> And we don&rsquo;t get to take any of the stuff<br> So ask yourself what do I want<br> </p>

<p>What is happiness for you<br> And optimize your existence around that thing<br> Enjoy the simple. street food. Good friends<br> If you don&rsquo;t want things then you&rsquo;ll enjoy people of all types<br> manage your digital shit tightly<br></p>
