<p>Noel.  She was the greatest consequence of a bad decision.  My Wife and I were buying cat food.  We stopped to look at the cats available for rescue and met Noel.  She was a scrawny, scared little lady who was found alone on a stretch of highway.  The agency told us that they did not expect her to live beyond the week.  Today, a little over 3 years later, we say goodbye and good memories to the one of the sweetest cats that I have ever known.</p>

<p>Noel passed away loved, and peacefully while resting in my wife's arms early this morning.  We held a private ceremony at home.  Our other cats, and our dog are doing well.</p>
