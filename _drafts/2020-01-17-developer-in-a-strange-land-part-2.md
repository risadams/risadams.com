<h2>Discipline &amp; Schedules</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In a typical office, you are naturally forced into a routine.  I need to wake up early, shower, and drive to the office in order to ensure that I am at my desk from "9-5".</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Without a forced schedule a typical day can become much less regimented, and you can find yourself working odd--longer hours to overcompensate. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Routine is key</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Getting yourself back into a strict routine is important, not only for your own health and sanity, but also for your teammates.  For me I tend to work better in the early morning,  so my daily routine typically involves:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>5:00am - 5:30 - Plan your day.  </li>
<li>5:30 - 8:30  Focused work on the most important items</li>
<li>8:30 - Hygiene break - food, shower, meditation.</li>
<li>9:30 - 11:00  -  Focused work or team meatings</li>
<li>11:00 - 12:00 - lunch</li>
<li>12:00-2:00pm  - focused work.</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>What about e-mail?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Typically when people tell you about remote work, they usually include a blurb about scheduling e-mail breaks in order to avoid interruption.  I find that this isn't really needed.  If I get an e-mail, phone call, text message, slack DM, etc.  I take a break--triage the message--and then decide when/how to respond.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:quote --></p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> Being agile means responding appropriately to change. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- /wp:quote --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I do this because it is important not just to remain busy, but to ensure that you are working on the correct tasks.  I will also respond to clients 24 hours a day (as long as I am available) .  This doesn't mean that I need to drop everything to respond to their request,  but I will re-adjust my schedule to work with their needs when I can.</p>
