<p>When my son was diagnosed with <a href="https://www.risadams.com/what-is-cdh/">CDH</a>.  The doctor told me to give up.  They told me I should abort.  They told me to donate his remains to the hospital for research so that some good could come from his condition.</p>

<p>Finding the right doctors made all the difference.  I chose to move across the country for a healthcare team with experience,  that actually cared.  and that has made all the difference.</p>

<p>My son is one week old today and has already completed his repair surgery.  If it wasn't for four tiny scars,  nobody would know that he wasn't born strong, and otherwise perfect.</p>

<p>I will be forever grateful to the team at <a href="https://www.hopkinsallchildrens.org/">Johns Hopkins</a> for  everything that they do, and for the love and support of the fantastic charities that have helped us on our journey.</p>
