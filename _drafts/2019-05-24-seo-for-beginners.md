<p>SEO is a common term for website administration and Digital Marketing which stands for Search Engine Optimization.  It is the practice of organizing your site content, meta-data, and link relationships in order to reach higher ranked positions in a search result list.  SEO is a basic strategy in any marketing plan and should be part of your standard practices.</p>

<h2>On-Page SEO</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On-Page SEO covers the content and structure of your site--anything within your physical control. This can also include technical details, such as page speed and code quality.</p>

<h2>Off-Page SEO</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Off-Page SEO includes factors beyond your control. This can include links from social media, or other websites and marketing activities, it may also include how your page ranks compared to other sites in your industry.  Because this information is all outside of your control it can be difficult to optimize.</p>

<h2>SEO Goals</h2>

<p>While SEO should always be on your mind while writing content, it is much more important to build and maintain the best, and most relevant, content you can.  Trying to 'game the system' will backfire.  The best SEO strategy you can have as a site owner is to provide frequently updated and high-quality content.</p>
