<p>Relationships are difficult.  Loving more than one partner at a time is not an escape from responsibility but rather a choice to build and shape a relationship network based upon mutual happiness rather than conforming to social expectations.  When you make the choice to open your heart to one or more partners, you become vulnerable and open to devastating heartbreak. Relationships mutate, and constantly evolve.  Love is not a state of being, Love is a constant and deliberate choice to sacrifice and serve for your relationship network.  Every relationship will change your life. Change is scary. Having a baseline set of ethics can aid in building stronger, safer, relationships. </p>
