<p>This series will focus on answering direct questions.<br> </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I do not promise to answer every question received, but I do promise that every answer will be honest, sometimes brutally so.<br> When applicable, I will provide links to resources, but most of the responses will be derive directly from past experiences, and stories.<br> If you wish to ask a question, feel free to reach out via <a href="mailto:qna@tuesdaybegins.com">e-mail</a>.</p>

<h2>What do I want more of?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Dissection: asking what do I want <em>MORE</em> of begins with an assumption.  What do I already have, but desire more.<br> This immediately excludes things that I want but do not yet possess.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3><strong>Short answer: I want closer relationships with my friends.</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Throughout my life I have always preferred the close company of a few good friends rather than keeping the company of many people whom I feel lesser kinships.<br><br />
Over the past few years my inner circle has experienced its own ebbs and tides as these things tend to do.  <br><br />
I have had close friends grow distant and fade away as new friends come forward to fill the gaps.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One 2019 goal was to meet and develop one new friendship each month.<br><br />
So far, I have not exactly had this happen, and realistically, it probably won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Despite the bleak prospects, I did manage to re-spark communication with an acquaintance whom I briefly met last Halloween.<br><br />
This person has quickly come into my life full-force and I look forward to a lifelong and deep relationship.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So how would one develop closer relationships?  A desire becomes a goal through motivation, and a goal with a plan becomes reality.</p>

<h3>My plan for building better relationships:</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":4} --></p>
<h4>1) Listen</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p> Everyone needs to be heard; but hearing without understanding is useless.<br> Most people are too busy thinking about what they should say next, that we fail to really listen to what our partners are communicating.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I plan to stop. take a quick breath, and really strive to hear what is being said.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":4} --></p>
<h4>2) Ask better questions.</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p> It is not enough to listen, you need to be able to provide the right feedback to let your partners know that they have been heard.<br> One method of doing this is parrot their speech with clarifying questions.  <br> This serves both to let them know that they are being heard, but also to clarify what they are saying and lead to deeper, more intimate, conversation.<br> (also note, use judiciously so that your partner feels like you are actively listening, and not mocking them.)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":4} --></p>
<h4>3) Listen to the person, not the words.</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p> It is not enough to simply listen to someone talk, pay attention to their tone, facial expressions, and body language. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":4} --></p>
<h4>4) Remember the important stuff.</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We live in a connected world of social accounts. The digitized knowledge of humanity is available literally in the palm of our hands.<br>There is no excuse to forget a birthday.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Our partners know we care, when we show them that we understand the things that are important to them.<br><br />
Pay attention to what people tell you they care about, write it down if you must; don't be afraid to use technology to your advantage.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":4} --></p>
<h4>5) Be honest, but cautious</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p> When meeting someone new, remember to pace yourself.  Telling your whole life story upfront can be overwhelming; especially if it contains some not so pretty parts.<br> That is not say that those parts don't matter--we are all the sum of our collective experiences both good and bad.  Own your past and be proud.<br> Remember that strong relationships are a bond mutually emulsified over small bits (like good mayonnaise) blended well over time.</p>
