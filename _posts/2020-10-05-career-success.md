## What does career success look like to me

* The ability to love the work that I do
* The ability to work on interesting problems that provide a challenge.
* The ability to surround myself with people I respect and admire
* The ability to respect my employer
* A fair trade between the hours I put in, and the compensation for those hours
* The ability to make that choice myself
