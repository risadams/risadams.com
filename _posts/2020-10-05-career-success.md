## What does career success look like to me

* The ability to love the work that I do
* The ability to work on interesting problems that provide a challenge.
* The ability to surround myself with people I respect and admire
* The ability to respect my employer
* A fair trade between the hours I put in, and the compensation for those hours
* The ability to make that choice myself

## What does career failure look like to me

* Doing boring work, that I hate to do
* Being the only point of failure for a project, or not having backup for my position available
* Being surrounded by people that I can't or don't admire or respect
* Working for a company that I am ashamed of
* Inflexible scheduling, or the inability to take time away if needed
* an unfair relationship between the hours I work, and the compensation received
