## Eight Dimensions of burnout

Everyone experiences [burnout]({{ '/career/2020/10/08/developer-burnout/' | relative_url }}) at least once during their career.
what many people don't realize is that it can be felt in many forms[^footnote], and manifest in different ways.

1. **Mental**: My mind cannot process any more; it’s fried.
1. **Physical**: My body is revolting; I have depleted my life force.
1. **Emotional**: These heavy or anxious emotions are exhausting me.
1. **Compassion**: I cannot hold any more loving space for anyone else; I’m tapped.
1. **Passion**: I love what I do, but I’ve given too much and pushed too hard.
1. **Relational**: I’ve been over-giving to others, my organization or my community/family, and I am over it.
1. **Survival**: I’m exhausted from trying to make ends meet and stay afloat.
1. **Superhero**: The weight of taking on so much is too much; I can’t hold it all anymore.

## The ugly truths

It is rare that burnout occurs on only one of these dimensions at a time,  and it can be extraordinarily stressful, but understanding what to look for can help determine the next steps to relief.
