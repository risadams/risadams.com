## Eight tips for becoming more productive as a developer

10 months ago I transitioned to full-time remote work.  First to help my medically fragile son, and then again for Covid-19 lockdown.  This is a list of things that have helped me cope, and still have a good work-life balance.

### 1. Reduce randomization

* Try to start and stop work at the same time every day.
* Try to take scheduled breaks, ideally at the same time every day

### 2. Reduce or eliminate time-wasting activities

* Cut down on social media, news, etc.
* turn off phone notifications.
* schedule e-mail checking. (limit to once per hour if possible)
* when checking messages, you don't need to respond immediately, schedule responses into batches

### 3. Create a workflow that works for you (or your team)

* If you work in a team, ensure that you all follow the same workflows as much as possible (Scrum, Kanban, etc.)
* if you are a solo developer find what works for you ans stick to it
* Constantly review your workflow patterns to ensure that they are working (keep doing what works, change what doesn't)  don't be afraid to try new things.
* Create and follow a template or framework that works for you
* Acknowledge that all projects are different and have different needs
* Work in the smallest possible chunks of tasks
* automate what you can

### 4. Use good project management tools

* Find the right tool for you.
* **Do NOT try to keep everything in your head.  You will fail.**
* Simpler is better
* Don't rely on ephemeral systems (e-mail, SMS, etc)
* Your goal should be able to quickly create or find tasks and plan your work
* Find something accessible:
  * Something cloud based and accessible whenever you need it is great
  * Don't rely on local systems dependent on network availability, or prone to failure.
* For larger team projects I use [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) or [TFS (Azure DevOps)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/server/).  Github is perfect for solo work, smaller teams, or Open Source projects.

### 5. Use tools to help you code faster

* Learn your code editor shortcuts, snippets, etc.
* Find plugins to help you (I love [Resharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/dotnet/) for C# or [RedGate](https://www.red-gate.com/products/sql-development/sql-toolbelt/) tools for SQL, but your opinions may vary)

### 6. Take breaks

* Overworking can cause [burnout]({{ '/career/2020/10/08/developer-burnout/' | relative_url }})
* Take at least one 15 minute break every 1-2 hours.

### 7. Minimize distractions

* Set limits and boundaries with co-workers or family members to avoid interruptions.
* Create a peaceful and productive work environment

### 8. Always seek to improve

* Learn new things every day
* Keep your passion for what you do
* invest in yourself and your career
* Dedicate time for learning.
