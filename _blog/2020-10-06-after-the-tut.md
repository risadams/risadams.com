## What do you do when you finish a tutorial

So you've finally got around to watching that YouTube video or Udemy course?  If you are like me you need to apply the knowledge that you've learned as soon as you can or you'll lose everything.  Here are few things you can do to keep things fresh.

### 1. Keep Going

extend the sample project with new features.  Change things up and experiment.

### 2. Do Something New

Start a new project using the techniques that you have learned

### 3. Do More Research

find another tutorial about the same content, but from another source. compare and contrast

### 4. Find alternatives

Build the same project again, using a different technology.  Experiment to find differences between your options and learn what you are comfortable working with
