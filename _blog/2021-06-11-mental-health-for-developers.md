How to be a happy developer is a question we get asked a lot. We're often asked what we feel is the best way to become a better developer. I want to share my thoughts and experience of getting to where I am today with anyone who is willing to listen. Making the right choices can open up whole new worlds of opportunities and happiness for you and your family.

Being a happy developer means being able to worry less about the big things. It means not worrying about an immediate paycheck, but thinking about the long-term impact of your work on people in the future. 

## A growing concern with developers

Over 40% of software developers have experienced mental health issues. We decided it was time to step up and do something about it. This is our first attempt, so we'd love your help.

Let's face it, programming is a job with a lot of responsibility. One of the biggest struggles developers have is dealing with feelings of depression and anxiety. These are very common experiences for people working in software because programming is inherently tied to being creative. Being creative requires a lot of mental health. It takes away from productive hours and can affect relationships at work if left untreated. Being able to identify the patterns that will help you manage your stress levels and feel more productive as a developer is important.

Productivity must be combined with purpose and learning, so you can get the most out of yourself and the products you work with. To be truly productive you need something that can help your brain unwind and recharge.

## The importance of having a healthy work environment for developers

Developers are often under a lot of pressure to deliver a product on time and in as few hours as possible. This can drive some developers crazy. If you’re one of them, I’m sure you can relate to feeling like there is a deadline coming and nothing you do can make it sooner. Of course, deadlines are a thing of the past and we can now work as long as we want (as long as we don’t have to work on something that is clearly beyond our budget).

It's important to realize that we developers are not alone in our struggles. The problems that we face are common problems and there isn't a one size fits all approach to solving them. I've found that it's helpful to look at others who have been through the same issues as you and see how they've handled them and what resources were useful or helpful to them. It's important that we continue to focus on improving our own quality of life and making sure that the game we play is as fun and accessible as possible for everyone!


## How I managed my mental health issues as a developer

Getting help for mental health issues is hard. A lot of people won't want to know about it, and if you're not careful some people will use your problems as an excuse not to do anything. I've been very open about my struggles with depression and anxiety in the past, and while it's never been easy I've found that talking about it helps other people. The Source is a place for developers who need support. It's not about being mean or judgmental, but trying to listen and provide advice where possible.

Happy developers don’t quit their day jobs. They don’t hide their identities behind screen names. They don’t avoid getting help from others. If you hope to be a good developer, it’s important to realize that you can't control what other people do in their lives. But it’s also true that we can shape what happens in our lives by how well we deal with the adversity that life throws our way, by staying positive even in the face of hurdles, and by building resilience in ourselves and in others.

## Give your brain a break

Connecting with other programmers online can help relieve the monotony of programming. Spending time with friends or family can also help de-stress and rejuvenate you.

If you are often stressed out about getting things done, give your brain a day off. Go for a run, have a shower, take a walk. Turn off all non-essential notifications on your phone and working from home. Turn off your email for a day. Unplug all the devices from your network so you can't share files or be distracted by annoying emails or social media updates. If you can, set aside some quiet space in your home (or office) for greatreads so you can read non-stop without getting distracted by people and notifications.

Anything that will trigger a release of endorphins will help clear your mind and give you a happier outlook on the day ahead. Try not to do this too often though as the longer you don’t take care of yourself the harder it will be for future projects to succeed.

The development world can be a lonely place. Relationships suffer when projects take longer than expected or deadlines slip through the cracks. You can avoid this common pitfall by giving your mind some quiet time to Job-hunt-and-Find-Fulfillment. It's a great time for you to recharge your batteries by writing novel, creating art, or playing board games with friends. Write things down! Exercise! Give yourself permission to be random!

## Talk about mental health in the tech community

Remember that it's not just your job to build the best product. It's also your job to make sure the community around your product is healthy and happy. Nothing helps lift your spirits like hearing from people who are similarly excited about their work. The more positive experience you have within the community, the more likely you are to build great products that will help other people as well.
