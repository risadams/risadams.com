## Surviving Remote Work

I have been a developer for almost 20 years.  During that time I have worked in many different types of industries and offices.  I have navigated cubical labyrinths and fought for "hot-desks".  But starting in January I began a new chapter -- 100% remote work.

### How it all changed

My son was diagnosed with a rare birth disorder called [Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH)](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia). The survival rate for this is typically around 50%, but is also strongly linked to the experience of the care team.  So we choose to relocate 3,000 miles away from our home, family, and friends in order to be treated by the best hospital and doctors in the world (for CDH).  

### What's Next

Over the next few articles I will be detailing the things that I am learning about full-time remote work,  and how to survive a brand-new kind of distraction.
