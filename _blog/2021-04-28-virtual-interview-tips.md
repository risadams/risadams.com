## De-stress your mess

Interviewing is one of the most stressful aspects of your career. but some of that stress and anxiety can be mitgated with practice and preperation.

While many companies these days are still accepting remote work, it won't be much longer until the industry returns to what it pretends to be normal.  These tips work great for virtual interviews but should help you out if you are in person as well

### Preperation

* Show up on time.
* Make sure your hardware (camera, mic) is tested, on, and working
* If you can find out what software the interviewer will be using and setup a test meeting for yourself to work out any sound or video issues in advance
* If possible, use a good external mic, and headphones.
* Check your surroundings for unwanted background noise.  I personally use a cheap green-screen behind my chair and project a neutral background.
* Invest on yourself.  Look professional.  Minimize distractions


## Seven Mistakes to avoid

#### 1. Ineffective Communication

The first goal of any interview is to measure how clearly and effectivly you communicate.  Nothing else is as important!  Be explicit and concise,  be as to-the-point as you can.  Everything you say can and should be taken at face value.

You should be able to take a moment or two to plan your responses without worry.  If you need more time don't be afraid to ask.

#### 2. Knowing all the answers

Don't fake it.  If you don't know the answer to something say so.  Once you are on the job you will be able to research things anyway.

It is much better to admit that you don't know, and follow up with a plan on how you will find out.

#### 3. Last Minute Preperations

This isn't a college exam.  Our brain cannot process and store all the information you need to have for an interview in any long term capacity.  

It is a much better use of your time to relax, get planty of food/water/rest and ensure that you are capable of putting your best self foreward.

#### 4. Memorizing All-The-Things!â„¢

This can be industry specific,  but you don't need to know how to do everything. Unless you are told in advance that you need to know or perform a specific task,  don't stress about it.

#### 5. Ignoring a bad culture fit

Not all teams are for you.  Don't overlook a potential toxic environment if it's not a good fit.  Your personal health and sanity are worth more than a quick hire.  Wait it out.  

#### 6. Make mistakes

your interviewer wants to see your process, not your answer. Unless you are 100% sure of the absolute one right way of doing a task, start small and talk it out.

#### 7. Glossing over the fundamentals

You might be an expert in one or two things,  but don't forget to showcase your breadth of fundamentals as well. Experts who can only focus in their area are less usefeull than experts who can lend a hand in other areas when the need arises
